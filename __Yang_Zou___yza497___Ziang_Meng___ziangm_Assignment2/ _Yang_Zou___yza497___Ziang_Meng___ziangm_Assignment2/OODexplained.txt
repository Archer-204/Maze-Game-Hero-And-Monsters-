1). The logic of hero’s movement:
The hero’s movement is designed such that the function return 1 if move successfully, 0 if failed or  dead. Let user pass a char “dir”, then the next step of hero is the direction of “dir”. If the next step is empty cell, then hero moves to next step, return 1. If next step is a “power”, hero gained a “power” and moves to next step, meanwhile randomly generate a new “power” return 1. If next step is a “monster”, and hero does not have a “power”, hero died, game over, return 0. If next step is a monster, and hero has a power, “monster” died, #power decrements, #monster killed increments, return 0. 

2).  The logic of monster’s movement
The movement of monster is implements such that it will be called automatically after hero moves. Let the previous direction of a monster be “pre-dir”. Let monsters follows the direction of “pre-dir” to move to next step. Before moving to next step, enable the cell which currently owned by monster. If next step is a hero and the hero has powers, then monster died,   #power decrements, #monster killed increments.  If next step is a hero and the hero does not have power, game over. Else if the next step is not wall, then monster moves to next step. If next step is a wall, then randomly generate a new direction, and follows the new direction. If the new direction is not wall, then monster move to the new direction and set the new direction as the “pre-direction”.if the new direction is still a wall, then move back words, it guarantees an available movement, and set the “pre-direction” to its back word.
